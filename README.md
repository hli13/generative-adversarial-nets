# Image Gneration with Generative Adversarial Networks

This project consists of training and generating images with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based on the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The discriminator/generator pair is trained utilizing Auxillary Classifier GAN (ACGAN) as well as Wasserstein GAN. Realistic looking images are generated from the trained  model.

In addition, to gain more insigts on how CNN works, synthetic images that maximizes the class output and maximizes a particular layer of features are generated using feature visualization techniques while we train the discriminator.

## Dependencies

```
numpy==1.16.4
matplotlib==3.1.0
torch==0.4.1
torchvision==0.2.1
```

## Dataset

The [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) has 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. 50,000 of them are labeled for training and 10,000 images for testing.
